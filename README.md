# Scheduler Project

Scheduler is an app designed to make it easy to book appointments and interviews. This was made as an assignment during my time at Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp. You can make it yourself using [Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/).
